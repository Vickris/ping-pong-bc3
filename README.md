Project goals
----------
This is my first javascript project in which I was supposed to create a working pong game using vanilla js and html 5 <canvas> only.
The game should allow single player and two player mode.
Users have the ability to choose the difficulty level: beginner, intermediate, pro
The first person to hit a score of 5 WINS.



Planned features
----------------
- [x] Main menu
- [x] 2 Player mode
- [x] 1 Player mode
- [x] Possibility to pause the game
- [x] Some simple sound effects

Additional features (if the basic features are working)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Change the difficulty level
- Sound settings: Turn sounds on/off
- Footprints to show ball trail
- Predictions showing where the computer thinks the ball will land
- Computer can play against itself




Problems and Learnings (My personal notes)
--------------------------------------------

- Passing variables and object properties around: You really need to pay attention to the scope!
- Adding eventslisteners and handlers successfully without prior experience in vanilla without using jquery: stack overflow will come in handy.
- No need to get stuck for hours over something when someone around you has done the project before or knows more than you. Ask for help.
